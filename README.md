# ITF Web Project
_Efrei M1 first semseter project_

## Context

---

The goal of this project is to **creat a web app** on a chosen topic.
Because of our major, IT for Finance, we decided to create a **finance related web app**.

## Idea

---

We want to develop a web application allowing the user to **create a budget for a project**.

### V1

The user should be able to do the following things :

- Enter all the income of the project in different categories he defines

- Enter all expenses of the project in different categories he defines

- Look at the result of his budget (income - expenses)

### Possible V2

The user should be able to do these more things

- Enter what he is earning and buying in his budget (he will be able to see what he needs to earn of expense left)

- See two different results : 
    
    - The one depending on what he budgeted
    
    - The one depending on what he is really earning and spending
